# SKChess-Engine
Simple chess engine under progress. I created my own GUI using Java Swing API to visualise the board. Engine can play against a user. User can set up any position for engine to play (good for solving chess puzzles). 

Things to Improve:
[ ] Move search Algorithm => Currently only searches 2 ply (moves) ahead. Thus, its a pretty weak algorithm. Need to look at alpha beta pruning algorithms and a position table. 
[ ] Some bugs with bishop and queen movement. 
[ ] Need to incorporate en passant and castling.
